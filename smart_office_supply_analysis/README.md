# 📊 Smart Office Supply Analysis

This Python script simulates a basic inventory evaluation for a fictional digital office equipment system. It analyzes unit quantities of technical supplies, identifies top-performing products, and flags critical stock levels using core Python logic. Designed as an entry-level task, this module demonstrates foundational dictionary operations and custom data checks within a controlled retail context.

## 📌 Key Features
- Initializes product quantities in a sales dictionary
- Calculates:
  - Total units sold across all inventory items
  - Highest-selling and lowest-selling products
- Automatically adds missing inventory entry (`WebVision Cam`)
- Adjusts product stock based on discovery of reporting errors
- Provides:
  - Recap of updated inventory
  - Critical stock alert (<50 units)
  - Data validation to ensure no negative values

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Built-in functions: `print()`, `sum()`, `max()`, `min()`
- Core structures: dictionaries, conditional logic
- List comprehensions for filtering
- Boolean validation across dataset
- Formatted string output (`f-strings`)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Navigate to the `smart_office_supply_analysis/` directory
3. Run the script with:

   `python smart_office_supply_analysis.py`

4. Review output summaries in console

## 💡 Skills Showcased
- Dictionary manipulation
- Conditional control flow (`if` statements)
- Basic data correction and integrity validation
- Creating reusable functions for filtering and checking data
- Output formatting and summarization

# üß± Smart Office Inventory Logic

Welcome to **Smart Office Inventory Logic**, a modular Python repository showcasing intermediate-to-advanced object-oriented programming through realistic simulations of employee management, workspace inventory, and internal user interactions. Every task is designed with professional structure and educational clarity ‚Äî perfect for portfolio demonstrations, interviews, or further extension.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository captures the evolution of Python knowledge applied to workplace logic. From single-class exercises to full multi-entity ecosystems, each module reflects thoughtful structuring, consistent naming, and scalable design.

You'll find tasks that demonstrate:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism  
- Modular file separation with reusable entities  
- Staff and user behavior simulation  
- Inventory validation, product logic and purchase tracking  
- Runtime data analysis: salary growth, working hours, expenditures

## üß© Modules Included

Each folder contains a standalone educational module with its own `.py` scripts and dedicated README.

| üìÅ Folder | üîé Description |
|-----------|----------------|
| `workspace_manager/` | Basic OOP logic with users, products, and expenditure tracking |
| `workspace_logic_executor/` | Advanced inheritance with login, discount logic, contract/freelance staff |
| `smart_office_orchestrator/` | High-level coordination across inventory and personnel |
| `smart_office_supply_analysis/` | Validates inventory lists and outputs structured reports |
| `supply_monitor/` | Core `Product` class designed for reuse in multiple tasks |

## üí° Concepts & Technologies Used

- Python 3 OOP (Class design, inheritance, protected/private fields)  
- `abc.ABC` for abstract base classes  
- Runtime analysis with `datetime` module  
- Encapsulated access via getters/setters  
- Dictionary and list handling  
- Polymorphism via `display_info()`  
- Clean file organization and modular architecture
